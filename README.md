## üéõÔ∏è Rotary Encoder Integration

The device supports an optional rotary encoder connected via the H1 header. This allows for:

* Turning lights on/off with a short press
* Enabling Bluetooth with a long press
* Adjusting brightness by rotating left or right

To use this feature, connect a compatible rotary encoder to the H1 pins as follows:

| Pin | Purpose          |
| --- | ---------------- |
| P1  | Encoder CLK      |
| P2  | Encoder DT       |
| P3  | Encoder SW (btn) |
| P4  | GND              |

Functionality is built-in and automatically enabled if the encoder is connected.

## üß∞ Requirements

* Node.js 20+
* npm
* PlatformIO CLI 6+

   ```bash
   cd filesystem && npm ci && npm run build
   ```
2. Set up the configuration app:

   ```bash
   cd ../app && npm ci
   ```
3. Upload firmware to the board:

   ```bash
   cd ../firmware
   pio run -t upload
   ```
4. Upload web UI files:

   ```bash
   pio run -t uploadfs
   ```

---

## üß© Configuration App (Angular)

Provides a Web Bluetooth-based UI to configure the controller.

## üîò BOOT Button Behavior

* **Short Press (< 2.5s):** Toggle light on/off
* **Long Press (> 2.5s):** Enable Bluetooth or reset its timeout
* **Firmware Update Mode:** Hold BOOT, press RESET

Bluetooth auto-disables after 15 seconds if unused.

## üåê REST API

The device offers a simple HTTP-based control interface using `GET` requests. While it resembles a REST API, all actions (even mutable ones) use `GET` methods.

### ‚ú© Endpoint Summary

| Method | Path                 | Description                           |
| ------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/state`             | Returns the current system state      |
| GET    | `/bluetooth`         | Enables or disables Bluetooth         |
| GET    | `/output/color`      | Updates the device color              |
| GET    | `/output/brightness` | Sets uniform brightness               |
| GET    | `/system/restart`    | Restarts the device                   |
| GET    | `/system/reset`      | Resets the device to factory defaults |

### üìò Detailed Endpoints

#### `GET /state`

Returns the complete system state as a JSON object.

#### `GET /output/color`

Sets the RGBW LED color channels individually.

* Parameters: `r`, `g`, `b`, `w` (0‚Äì255)
* Example: `/output/color?r=255&g=100&b=50&w=0`
* Turns channels ON automatically if value > 0.

#### `GET /output/brightness`

Applies a uniform brightness level to all channels.

* Parameter: `value` (0‚Äì255)
* Value of 0 turns channels OFF.

#### `GET /bluetooth`

Toggles Bluetooth functionality.

* Parameter: `state=on` enables; any other value disables
* Example: `/bluetooth?state=on`
* Disabling Bluetooth causes the device to restart.

#### `GET /system/restart`

Restarts the device gracefully.

#### `GET /system/reset`

Performs a full factory reset (clears persistent storage) and restarts the device.

### Notes

* All endpoints return JSON and use the header:

  ```
  Cache-Control: no-store
  ```
* For true REST semantics, POST/PUT should replace some GETs.

## üîÑ WebSocket Protocol

## üîß OTA Updates

Firmware and filesystem updates are supported over-the-air using HTTP POST.

### Endpoint

* `POST /update`

  * Parameters:

    * `file`: Required firmware or filesystem binary
    * `name`: Optional; use `filesystem` to indicate a filesystem image
    * `md5`: Optional; 32-character hash for file integrity verification

### Examples

```bash
curl -u user:pass -F "file=@firmware.bin" http://<device-ip>/update
curl -u user:pass -F "name=filesystem" -F "file=@littlefs.bin" http://<device-ip>/update
curl -u user:pass -F "file=@firmware.bin" "http://<device-ip>/update?md5=<hash>"
```

### Notes

* OTA updates are protected by Basic Auth
* Only one upload is accepted at a time; others are rejected
* If `md5` is provided and doesn't match, update is aborted
* The device restarts automatically after a successful upload

See full details in the [OtaHandler documentation](doc/OTA.md).

## üõ†Ô∏è Build & Flash

```bash
cd filesystem && npm install && npm run build
cd ../firmware && pio run -t upload
